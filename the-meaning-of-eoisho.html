        <h1 style="color:red;">Question 1: What does eoisho mean????</h1>
        <p>Answer: It doesn't mean anything. It's not an acronym and it doesn't bear any special significance.<br>A while back, I decided that I needed to adopt a new username to supersede all the archaic ones that I had been using (see below). I needed something that was short and widely available, and thus, eoisho was born.  Now please stop asking me</p>

        <h2>Question 3: Why does this page look like it's from 2001?</h2>
